Example Processing Procedures
***********************************


This chapter details common processing procedures that utilize the tools described within the manaual. A sample project has an IRB protocol 
number of **2022.001**. Since a period ('.') is an illegal character for the <project_identifier>, we will specify **2022-001** as the 
<project_identifier> for the examples provided herein. You should work with Dr. Sherwood to determine your project identifier.
