Philips 3.0T Ingenia Cx
=======================

The CoNNECT MRI facility was created when Dr. Sherwood received funding from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and State of Ohio
Department of Higher Education to purchase and install a 3-Tesla (T) MRI for the enhancement of defense-related research. The MRI scanner 
installation was completed on March 31, 2022. The Philips 3.0T Ingenia Cx is obviously at the core of the CoNNECT. This MRI is capable of 
performing state-of-the-art functional and anatomical neuroimaging. Additional MRI components can be found at the `equipment section of the 
CoNNECT laboratory website <https://science-math.wright.edu/lab/center-of-neuroimaging-and-neuro-evaluation-of-cognitive-technologies/equipment>`__.
